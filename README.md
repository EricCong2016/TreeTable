# Aephyr

this is a fork/clone from the project at https://code.google.com/p/aephyr/ -- "Swing components, accessories, utilities, etc for use in a GUI", released under the GNU LGPL. The original author is `drael4...@gmail.com`

the mere purpose of this is for me to have a bookmark on the project whose layout has been adjusted to build and run with the simple-build-tool: `sbt test:run`.

the tests show how to use trees inside lists and tables basically, plus other additions such as sorted table rows.

the separate `nimbuscreator` directory has been omitted.
